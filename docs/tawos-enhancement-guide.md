## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
```

### Database Setup

1. Enable the pgvector extension in your Supabase project
2. Run the migration script: `scripts/create-tawos-vector-table.sql`
3. The script will create:
   - `tawos_user_stories` table with vector support
   - Vector similarity search function
   - Proper indexes for performance
   - Row Level Security policies

### Priority Weights

The system uses configurable weights for priority calculation:

- **Business Value** (30%): Impact on business goals and revenue
- **User Impact** (25%): Effect on user experience and satisfaction
- **Complexity** (20%): Technical difficulty and implementation effort
- **Risk** (15%): Potential issues and uncertainties
- **Dependencies** (10%): Reliance on other components or systems

## Usage

### 1. Story Generation

```typescript
const params = {
  featureDescription:
    "As a Product Manager, I want to generate user stories using AI, so that I can quickly create high-quality backlogs",
  numberOfStories: 5,
  complexity: "moderate",
  workspaceId: "workspace-id",
  priorityWeights: DEFAULT_WEIGHTS,
  teamMembers: teamMembers,
  useTAWOS: true,
};

const { stories, error } = await generateTAWOSStories(params);
```

### 2. Team Member Assignment

```typescript
const assignment = getOptimalTeamAssignment(story, teamMembers);
// Returns: { assignedMember, reason, confidence }
```

### 3. Sprint Planning

```typescript
const { sprint, error } = await createSprintFromStories(
  stories,
  teamMembers,
  2
);
```

## Story Structure

Generated stories include the following fields:

- **title**: Concise story title
- **role**: Specific user role
- **want**: Specific capability or feature
- **benefit**: Clear business or user benefit
- **acceptanceCriteria**: Array of specific, measurable criteria
- **storyPoints**: Fibonacci sequence estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- **businessValue**: Score from 1-5
- **priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **tags**: Technical skills required
- **requirements**: Specific implementation requirements
- **estimatedTime**: Time estimate in hours
- **description**: Detailed description
- **antiPatternWarnings**: Array of potential issues to avoid
- **successPattern**: Recommended approach for success
- **completionRate**: Historical completion rate (0-1)
- **velocity**: Estimated velocity for this story type

## Migration from Pinecone

This system has been migrated from Pinecone to Supabase Vector Database for better integration and cost efficiency. The migration includes:

1. **Replaced Pinecone client** with Supabase pgvector functions
2. **Updated all vector operations** to use Supabase's vector similarity search
3. **Maintained all existing functionality** including team assignment and pattern analysis
4. **Improved performance** with native database integration
5. **Reduced costs** by eliminating external vector database service

## Database Schema

The `tawos_user_stories` table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tawos_user_stories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    embedding vector(3072), -- OpenAI text-embedding-3-large vectors
    metadata JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The metadata JSONB field stores all story information including:

- title, description, role, want, benefit
- acceptanceCriteria, storyPoints, businessValue
- priority, tags, requirements, estimatedTime
- completionRate, successPattern, antiPatterns
- assignedTeamMember, and other TAWOS-specific fields

## Anti-pattern Detection

### FBI Sentinel Anti-patterns

1. **Requirements Confusion**

   - Vague words: "maybe", "possibly", "might", "could", "should"
   - Insufficient acceptance criteria (< 3 criteria)
   - Non-specific, non-measurable criteria

2. **Scope Overload**

   - Multiple features in single story
   - Excessive use of "and", "also", "additionally"
   - Too many acceptance criteria (> 5)

3. **Missing Dependencies**

   - Implied dependencies without explicit declaration
   - Sequential requirements without dependency mapping

4. **Unrealistic Estimates**
   - Words like "quick", "fast", "simple", "easy", "just", "only"
   - Story points not following Fibonacci sequence
   - Time estimates not aligned with complexity

## Team Assignment Algorithm

### Scoring Factors

1. **Skill Matching** (60% weight)

   - Direct skill matches
   - Partial skill matches
   - Role-aligned skills

2. **Level Matching** (30% weight)

   - Complexity requirements
   - Priority requirements
   - Team member experience level

3. **Role Alignment** (10% weight)
   - Role-specific skill requirements
   - Functional area alignment

### Confidence Calculation

- **Skill Match Percentage**: 60% of confidence
- **Level Match**: 30% of confidence
- **Role Match**: 10% of confidence

## Sprint Planning Features

### Velocity Calculation

- Base velocity per team member: 8 story points/sprint
- Level multipliers: Junior (0.6), Mid (1.0), Senior (1.4), Lead (1.2)
- Availability factor: hours available / 40 hours

### Capacity Planning

- Sprint capacity = Team velocity Ã— Sprint duration
- Story distribution by priority and complexity
- Overload detection (>120% capacity)

### Warnings and Recommendations

- **Overload Risk**: When total story points exceed capacity
- **Velocity Variation**: When team velocity varies significantly
- **Critical Story Overload**: Too many critical stories
- **Large Story Detection**: Stories > 8 points
- **Skill Overload**: Heavy use of specific skills
- **Dependency Issues**: Stories with dependencies

## Best Practices

### Story Writing

1. Use specific, measurable acceptance criteria
2. Follow the exact "As a... I want... So that..." format
3. Keep stories focused on single features
4. Use realistic story point estimates
5. Include relevant technical tags

### Team Management

1. Maintain accurate skill profiles
2. Update availability regularly
3. Track velocity over time
4. Balance workload across team members
5. Consider pairing for knowledge transfer

### Sprint Planning

1. Limit critical stories to 1-2 per sprint
2. Break large stories (>8 points) into smaller pieces
3. Consider dependencies when sequencing stories
4. Monitor skill distribution across stories
5. Review anti-pattern warnings before committing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No TAWOS patterns found**: Check Pinecone API key and index
2. **Poor team assignments**: Verify team member skills and levels
3. **Sprint overload**: Reduce story count or extend sprint duration
4. **Anti-pattern warnings**: Review and refine story descriptions

### Performance Optimization

1. Cache TAWOS patterns for similar features
2. Batch team assignments for multiple stories
3. Pre-calculate team velocity
4. Use incremental updates for sprint planning
